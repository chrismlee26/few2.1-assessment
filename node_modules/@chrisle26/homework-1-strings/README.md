A library of reusable code that operates on strings. Strings are one of the most common data types to work with. These functions solve the problems below:

1. capitalize() makes the first character of a given string Uppercase.
2. allCaps() makes all characters in a string UPPERCASE.
3. capitalizeWords() Capitalizes The First Letter Of Each Word in a string.
4. removeExtraSpaces() removes any --extra spaces and whitespace-- in a string.
5. kebobCase() converts a string to kebob-case and sets the string to lowercase. Any seperator can be added as a second parameter.
6. snakeCase() converts a string to snake_case and sets the string to lowercase.
7. camelCase() converts a string to camelCase.
8. shiftChar() takes the first letter of a string and moves it to the end of a string.
9. makeHashTag() converts a string into a #HashTagString with a maximum of 3 words and capitalizes each word.
10. isEmpty() returns true if the string only contains whitespace.
